A variant on othello. 
This version is not the finished product. This is how far i got with my coding alone. 
Another person was later responsible for adding sounds to the code. It is also made to play online connecting to a server to manage highscore. 

As a result it is a bit unfinished and unpolished. The online version of the game has since been taken down and can no longer be played.

Instructions are in the game. In the menu click "How to play"
